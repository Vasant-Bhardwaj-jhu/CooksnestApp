Individual Contribution Report

1. For this iteration, I was mostly focused on the backend, and specifically the YelpAPI.
   In order to make the Yelp API function, I helped implement the `parse-one-event` and
   `parse-events`. in addition, I helped with the `Mapquest` API information.


2. In terms of team members who performed above and beyond, I would like to point out
   Aryaman, Sabrina, and Peter, who helped out a lot in this. Sabrina and I worked together to get the API's
   running ,and she was a major help with the major API's. Peter was also very helpful, as he started work on the
   Django databasing and helped get the database up and running. He also worked on some frontend. Aryman was
   vital to the databasing ,and also worked on a good portion of the HTML files.
